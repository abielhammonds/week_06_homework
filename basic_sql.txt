PRACTICE PROBLEM 1

Write a query to select all of the columns in the tutorial.us_housing_units table without using *.

SELECT year,
       month,
       month_name,
       south,
       west,
       midwest,
       northeast
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units

I've listed each column name in the data set to call all of the columns.


PRACTICE PROBLEM 2

Write a query to select all of the columns in tutorial.us_housing_units and rename them so that their first letters are capitalized.

SELECT year as "Year",
       month as "Month",
       month_name as "Month Name",
       south as "South",
       west as "West",
       midwest as "Midwest",
       northeast as "Northeast"
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units

I've renamed each column with a capital letter and space instead of underscore for month_name.
