PRACTICE PROBLEM 1

Write a query to select all of the columns in the tutorial.us_housing_units table without using *.

SELECT year,
       month,
       month_name,
       south,
       west,
       midwest,
       northeast
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units

I've listed each column name in the data set to call all of the columns.


PRACTICE PROBLEM 2

Write a query to select all of the columns in tutorial.us_housing_units and rename them so that their first letters are capitalized.

SELECT year as "Year",
       month as "Month",
       month_name as "Month Name",
       south as "South",
       west as "West",
       midwest as "Midwest",
       northeast as "Northeast"
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units

I've renamed each column with a capital letter and space instead of underscore for month_name.

PRACTICE PROBLEM 3

Write a query that uses the LIMIT command to restrict the result set to only 15 rows.

SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units
 LIMIT 15

This query has called the first 15 rows of the data set.

PRACTICE PROBLEM 4

Did the West Region ever produce more than 50,000 housing units in one month?

SELECT year,
       month,
       month_name,
       west
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units
 WHERE west > 50

This query called the year, month, month_name, and west columns - only if the number (of housing units) in the west column was greater than 50(thousand).
The answer is yes, there were 3 months where the west region produced more than 50,000 housing units.


PRACTICE PROBLEM 5

Did the South Region ever produce 20,000 or fewer housing units in one month?

SELECT year,
       month,
       month_name,
       south
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units
 WHERE south <= 20

This query called the year, month, month_name, and south columns - only if the number (of housing units) in the south column was less than or equal to 20(thousand).
The answer is yes, there were 4 months where the south region produced 20,000 or fewer housing units.

PRACTICE PROBLEM 6

Write a query that only shows rows for which the month name is February.

SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units
 WHERE month_name = 'February'

When I use the equal operator, I can set the month_name column equal to the value 'February'.

PRACTICE PROBLEM 7

Write a query that only shows rows for which the month_name starts with the letter "N" or an earlier letter in the alphabet.

SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units
 WHERE month_name <= 'N'

This query returned all months that start before 'N' alphabetically (ex: December, May).  
It did not return November because Nov...comes after N in the alphabet.
It did not return September or October because S and O come after N in the alphabet.

PRACTICE PROBLEM 8

Write a query that calculates the sum of all four regions in a separate column.

SELECT year,
       month,
       month_name,
       west,
       south,
       midwest,
       northeast,
       west + south + midwest + northeast AS all_regions
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units

This query returned all column (I listed them, you can't use *) and a calculated column adding the number of all housing units for each region together.

PRACTICE PROBLEM 9

Write a query that returns all rows for which more units were produced in the West region than in the Midwest and Northeast combined.

SELECT year,
       month,
       month_name,
       west,
       midwest,
       northeast,
       midwest + northeast as west_and_northeast
    FROM tutorial.us_housing_units
  WHERE west > (midwest + northeast)

Well, this was interesting!  I included the arithmatic in the where statement to limit the number of rows to what was asked.
Then I went back and added the midwest + northeast calculated column, to visually check the results.
If I included the west > (midwest + northeast) in the select statement, I get a boolean column of true/false values.
But then, when I tried to limit using a where statement, on my calculated column (boolean = true) I got an error.

PRACTICE PROBLEM 10

Write a query that calculates the percentage of all houses completed in the United States represented by each region. Only return results from the year 2000 and later.

SELECT year,
       month,
       month_name,
       south / (south + west + midwest + northeast) * 100 AS percent_south,
       west / (south + west + midwest + northeast) * 100 AS percent_west,
       midwest / (south + west + midwest + northeast) * 100 AS percent_midwest,
       northeast / (south + west + midwest + northeast) * 100 AS percent_northeast
    FROM tutorial.us_housing_units
  WHERE year  >= 2000

This query returns the calcuated columns and limits results to years greater than or equal to 2000.
For the sake of brevity, I only inlcuded the calculated columns - not each region's original data.
